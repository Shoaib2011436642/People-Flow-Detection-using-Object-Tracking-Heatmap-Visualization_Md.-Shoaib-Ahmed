# People Flow Detection Using Object Tracking & Heatmap Visualization
### By Md. Shoaib Ahmed

## Project Overview
This project detects and tracks people in a video stream while visualizing their movement patterns through a heatmap. It uses deep learning-based object detection combined with tracking algorithms to monitor people flow in a given area and highlight frequently visited zones.

## Purpose of the Project
The primary goal is to provide insights into human movement patterns in public or private spaces. Such analysis can help in:
- Crowd management and safety
- Store layout optimization
- Event planning and monitoring
- Security and surveillance

## ðŸ› Technologies Used
- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **YOLOv11-seg** â€“ for person detection and segmentation
- **Norfair** â€“ for object tracking
- **OpenCV** â€“ for video processing
- **NumPy** â€“ for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** â€“ for heatmap generation
- **Google Drive** â€“ for saving outputs

## Model Used & Implementation
- **YOLOv11-seg** was used to detect and segment people from each video frame.
- **Norfair** tracked detected individuals across frames, assigning consistent IDs to each.
- Movement coordinates were recorded over time.
- A heatmap was generated by overlaying these coordinates to show high-density regions.
- The processed video and heatmap images were saved to Google Drive for review.

## Expected Results
- A processed video with bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and unique tracking IDs for each person.
- A heatmap image clearly showing the most frequently occupied areas.
- Insights into people movement flow and congestion points.

## Future Improvements
- Real-time implementation with live camera feeds.
- Multi-camera integration for wider coverage.
- Integration with analytics dashboards for automated reporting.
- Advanced tracking using re-identification models.
- Support for different object categories beyond people.
